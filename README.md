# RWTH Mensa Scrape

Ever been annoyed by the long loading time of the RWTH App, when you just want
to know what you can eat today? Or were you frustrated searching for the mensa
website on your desktop, clicking through the antiquated website of the STW?

Well, no longer! Take a look at
[mensa.alexbaron.me](https://mensa.alexbaron.me/), and get the current mensa
menu - always up to date, always fast. In fact, the global caching used through
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is probably overkill. But hey, it works!
